      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>In this project I worked with a team to design and develop a chess board that allows the user to play remotely using a physical board.
        We achieved this using magnetic chess pieces, a movable electromagnet, and hall effect sensors. The electromagnet is affixed to a 2d system of rails 
        and stepper motors. One motor controls movement in the x direction, while the other controls movement in the y direction. By controlling when the electromagnet is 
        activated and controlling its movement via the stepper motors, we are able to precisely control how the pieces move. This is how the opponents moves are enacted on the board. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To sense which pieces the main player moves we use the hall effect sensors. Each square on the board is affixed with a hall effect sensor which detects whether 
        there is a piece on each square. When the player makes a move and hits the "move completed" button, we take a snapshot of the board to detect which piece has been 
        moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turns alternate between the physical player and the opponent. Once the physical player has made his/her move, we wait for a command over the UART channel. 
        This command will tell us what move the opponent would like to make using smith notation. Once the move is received, the board then uses the electromagnet to enact 
        the move.

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      <p>
        This system uses 1 Nucleo-L476RG development board microcontroller as the main controller for the chess board. On game start a snapshot is taken of the board 
        by reading each hall effect sensor. Four 16:1 muxes are used to connect the hall effect sensors to 4 ADC channel pins on the Nucleo board. Row by row we sample each 
        hall effect sensor to determine if a piece is on that square by comparing the reading to a threshold value. If the sensor is pulled low it means the magnet within a  
        chess piece is on that square. If not, then there is no piece on that square.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player then moves a piece and hits the "move completed" button. The board then takes another snapshot of the board and compares it to the previous snapshot. 
        This allows the board to determine which move was made and send it to a computer using UART over a USB connection. Once the opponent receives which move was made, 
        he/she can send a move back to the board using smith notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the board receives the opponent's move, it calculates how to control the motors based on what piece is being moved and where the source and destination squares 
        are. It then turns off the electromagnet, moves it to the source square, turns on the electromagnet, moves to the destination square in the correct manner, then turns 
        off the electromagnet and returns back to the electromagnet resting place. The player is then free to make another move.
      </p>
